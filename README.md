# About

This is a small Rust command-line tool that checks if a list of servers or links are up and running 

## Usage

Replace FILENAME.txt with the name of your text file .
```sh
./srvcheck /path/to/directory/FILENAME.txt
```
The program will make an HTTP GET request to each URL and print the status of each server.
